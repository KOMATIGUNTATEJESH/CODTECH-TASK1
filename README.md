OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT: SIMPLE CALCULATOR USING PYTHON

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of creating a simple calculator using Python is to build a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator should take input from the user.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
The key activities involved in creating a simple calculator using Python include:

User Input: Prompting the user to input the numbers and select the operation they want to perform.

Performing Operations: Implementing functions or methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice.

Error Handling: Ensuring that the calculator can handle invalid inputs or divide-by-zero scenarios gracefully.

Displaying Results: Outputting the result of the calculation to the user in a clear and understandable format.

Looping: Optionally, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program by using a loop.

User Interface (optional): Depending on the complexity and intended use of the calculator, you may want to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.

Here's a breakdown of these activities in a bit more detail:

User Input:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Performing Operations:

Implement functions or methods to perform each arithmetic operation. These functions should take two numbers as input and return the result of the operation.
Error Handling:

Check for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric characters or unsupported operations.
Handle divide-by-zero errors if the user selects division.
Displaying Results:

Output the result of the calculation to the user in a clear and understandable format. This could be done through the console or a GUI if you're implementing one.
Looping:

Optionally, allow the user to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program by using a loop (e.g., a while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit).
User Interface (optional):

Depending on your requirements, you may choose to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. This can enhance user experience and make the calculator more user-friendly.
